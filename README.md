# Sprint4- Restful API -CRUD
In sprint 4, the main objective is to Build an Express application with CRUD API Gateway endpoint functionality for the web crawler to read/write/delete/update the list of website/webpages to crawl. 

The Restfull API(that follow a certain set of rules) used http protocole. HTTP protocole is basically a protocole to transfer data on the web. it is the statesless protocole(means when we send the request, it constians all the necassary information in the request.) 


# This project is divided into different parts:
1-Crud operation on express server with api gateway

2-Read/write on MongoDB database

3-Create/delete alarm when URL added or deleted

4-Full functionality of CI/CD on AWS.
